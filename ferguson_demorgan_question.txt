Subject: Question about De Morgan's Laws in ACrQ (Ferguson 2021)

Dear Professor Ferguson,

I am implementing the tableau systems from your 2021 paper "Tableaux and Restricted Quantification for Systems Related to Weak Kleene Logic" 
and have encountered a question about the status of De Morgan's laws in ACrQ.

In your paper, you make the following statements:

1. On page 7, after introducing restricted quantifiers for wK, you note: "We note that although the above quantifiers 
align with reasonable intuitions about restricted quantifiers, DeMorgan's laws fail. Despite this, the quantifiers will 
satisfy DeMorgan's laws for S*fde and AC, as we will see in subsequent sections."

2. On page 13, when discussing the bilateral approach: "The reader can confirm that the bilateral approach in fact improves 
on the presentation for wK inasmuch as DeMorgan's laws are reestablished; as S*fde and AC are our actual targets, this should 
relieve concerns about their failure in wK."

3. Definition 17 (page 14) shows the bilateral translation where De Morgan's laws hold:
   - (¬(φ ∧ ψ))* = (¬φ)* ∨ (¬ψ)*
   - (¬(φ ∨ ψ))* = (¬φ)* ∧ (¬ψ)*

4. Definition 18 (page 15) defines ACrQ by dropping the general negation elimination rule from wKrQ and adding bilateral predicate rules.

My question concerns the precise sense in which De Morgan's laws are "reestablished" in ACrQ:

Given that ACrQ drops general negation elimination, a formula like ¬(P(a) ∧ Q(a)) cannot be decomposed in the tableau system. 
When testing the inference ¬(P(a) ∧ Q(a)) ⊢ (¬P(a) ∨ ¬Q(a)) in an ACrQ tableau (where ¬P(a) becomes P*(a) in transparent mode), 
the inference appears to fail because:

1. The premise ¬(P(a) ∧ Q(a)) remains undecomposed (no negation elimination)
2. The conclusion P*(a) ∨ Q*(a) requires both P*(a) and Q*(a) to be false
3. No tableau rules connect these formulas

However, your statement suggests De Morgan's laws are reestablished. Are you referring to:

(a) A semantic property at the level of the bilateral interpretation (i.e., the laws hold in the AC/S*fde models even if not 
provable in ACrQ tableaux)?

(b) A meta-theoretic property about the relationship between ACrQ proofs and their bilateral translations (via Lemma 6)?

(c) Something else that would make De Morgan's laws provable within the ACrQ tableau system itself?

I want to ensure my implementation correctly reflects your intended system. Any clarification would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and for this fascinating paper.

Best regards,
Claude Code
