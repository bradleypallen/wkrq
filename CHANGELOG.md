# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.3.1] - 2025-08-25

### Fixed

- **Bilateral Predicate Conversion Bug** - Fixed critical bug in ACrQ parser
  - `_convert_to_bilateral` was incorrectly re-converting BilateralPredicateFormula objects
  - This caused formulas like `Van*(X)` to become `Van**(X)` with wrong attributes
  - Glut detection now works correctly for formulas like `[forall X Sedan(X)]~Van(X)` with `Van(c435)`
  - Fixed by checking for BilateralPredicateFormula before PredicateFormula in the instanceof chain

## [3.3.0] - 2025-08-24

### Added

- **ACrQ Theory Manager with LLM Integration** - New interactive CLI for building and reasoning with logical theories
  - `acrq-llm` command for interactive theory management
  - Natural language assertions with automatic formula translation
  - `claim` command for LLM-verified factual assertions
  - Paraconsistent reasoning with gap and glut detection
  - Theory persistence in JSON format
  - Comprehensive inference engine with LLM support
  - File protection to prevent accidental overwrites

### Changed

- **Parser Mode Handling** - Theory manager now uses MIXED mode by default
  - Fixes issues with formulas mixing `~P(x)` and `P*(x)` syntax
  - Eliminates false positives in bilateral predicate detection

## [3.2.1] - 2025-08-24

### Fixed

- **LLM Negative Evidence Handling** - Fixed critical semantic issue in ACrQ tableau LLM integration
  - LLM negative evidence (FALSE, TRUE) now creates bilateral predicates (t:P*) instead of contradictions
  - Enables proper paraconsistent handling of conflicting evidence between formal rules and real-world knowledge
  - Example: When formal rules derive "Pluto is a planet" but LLM knows it's not, both t:Planet(pluto) and t:Planet*(pluto) coexist as a glut
  - Updated tests and documentation to reflect correct glut-based semantics
  - Fixed example 04_llm_integration.py to properly load .env file for API keys

  proving
  - Propositional subsumption: stronger formulas subsume weaker ones
    (e.g., `p` subsumes `p ∨ q`)
  - First-order subsumption: universals subsume instances with
    consistency checking (e.g., `P(X)` subsumes `P(a)`)
  - Three-valued logic subsumption: sign relationships based on truth
    value sets (e.g., `T:p` subsumes `M:p`)
- **Industrial-grade tableau optimizations**
  - Forward subsumption filtering: incoming subsumed formulas are rejected
  - Backward subsumption marking: existing formulas marked as subsumed
    when stronger ones are added
  - Rule application optimization: subsumed formulas skipped during expansion
- **Comprehensive test coverage** with 27 new subsumption tests
- **Performance benchmarking** showing significant optimization benefits
- **Soundness preservation** ensuring tableau correctness while optimizing performance
